A simple Chess application to pratice OOP and logic programming, as well as graphics

It is build with a full JFrame and JPanel, with graphics drawn on the panel.

I wanted to practice using gamestates rather than have a simple interface, to possibly leave room for more game modes in the future. For example having a different board created for a checkers game. Currently the gamestates serve no function though.

Known issues:
No check detection
En passant implementation
